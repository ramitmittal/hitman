A TUI HTTP client for debugging request/response headers inspired by [restclient.el](https://github.com/pashky/restclient.el) and [httpie](https://github.com/httpie/httpie).

## Features

* Type a request definition and press `TAB` to send.
* Use `#` to comment lines in input.
* Use `"` for escaping spaces.
* Request + response headers are printed in a scrollable viewport.
* Sessions are auto-saved on exit.
